To allow fetch() to work on javescript with local files, you have to run : "npm install -g http-server" , this will allow you to install a local server to allow fetch. 
    Then simply run http-server in any of your project directories:
        d:\my_project> http-server
        
        or

        http-server "d:\my_project"
        http-server "C:\Users\Ted Cruz\Desktop\SupplyJeT"

-----------------Install React JS----------------------------------

Inside the main proyect folder, enter following commands:

REACT JS

    To install react-js :     
    
        npm install -g create-react-app

    To create app in react :

        create-react-app [name-of-app]

    If previous steps don't work, try this:    

        To update tar (because to fix dependencies error needed for React JS):    

                npm install -g tar@latest
                npm install tar@6 -g

        If previous command don't work try ignoring the error with:

            npm i tar

        Alternatively you can follow these steps: First, install npm using the command:

            sudo apt install npm

        Then download the required dependencies: 

            npx create-react-app [name-of-app]

        Then use the following command to run the application. Error has been fixed.

            cd [name-of-app]
            npm start


    Starts the development server.:
        
        cd [name-of-app]

        npm start

    Bundles the app into static files for production and starts the test runner.
    
        npm run build

    [DO NOT USE] Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
        
        npm run eject


----------------------------Moving between directories inside command-line (cmd)-------------------------------

    To point to folder in cmd use "/" instead of "\".
    
    To travel to directory with "spaces" in between word you have to surround forlder with quotations = "folder"

        C:/Users/"Ted Cruz"/Desktop/SupplyJeT/   or   cd C:/Users/"Ted Cruz"/Desktop/SupplyJeT/

    To navigate up one directory level use:

        cd ~
